# Tic-Awesome-Tac

The game was created by inspiration of school friends. Good old tic-tac was just the start ;)

logic of game is somehow different: you need to place a line instead of figure. When your line closes a rectangle it means you have occupied it.
In the end all X's and O's are counted. Figure of Maximum count is a winner.

For now realized some lame gif animation-instruction and the engine of game with play mode player-computer. Also using UIScrollView as more convinient way to drag and scale.

In future:
  - multiplayer (two players on one/two devices)
  - smarter AI, not just winning algorithm
  - sounds, music?
